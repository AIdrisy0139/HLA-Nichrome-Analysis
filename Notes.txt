Integral transform between frequency and time, go both way
Time = > Frequency
Space => Spatial Frequency
Basis becomes sins and cosines
Change of basis into the frequency domain
    - Similar to cartesian to polar, cylindrical
    - Cos and Sin are mathematically perpinduclar [Orthogonal]
Euler Identity used allows the writing of producs of sin and cos to be just cos
Sin comonents integrate to 0
Cos and sin to complex exponentials

# Why do we care?
Frequency coponents of the signal, most functions are composed of many diff freqs summed
 - Fourier Series to aperiodic functions
  - Decomp a function into freq components in fourier domain
Fourier Domain allows for some easier maniuplations compared to the original domain (time domain)

Example
 - Sin wave = one frequence ( the frequency if the sine wave)
 - A square = many different frequencies required 
    -Square wave into its frequency components

Taylor and Macularan are local approx [ Power Seires ]
Foruier said infinte series of sin and cos approx globally (Fourier Seires)

BASIS FUNCTIONS
    -i j k cartesian basis
    - Sin and cos also Orthogonal
    -2 Basis vectors, but infintie basis functions
        -Increment frequency of cos and sin
        -Lets us get each frequency components
    - More diff sins w/ diff freq = > more accurate approx
    - Weighted sin and cos as well ( so how much of a certain frequency = find frequence and look at coef)
    - Sin/cos are unitless = > freq components in freq Space
    - All DE are solved using real + complex exp = > FT used to solve its
    - FT w/ real exponents => LAPLACE transform

HOW IT WAS DERIVED
    - Start with approximating a function of period 2pi
    - Generalized to any 2L periodic function (L= 2 and we go back)
    - We can go between time and Space

Integrate to get coeffs 
Aperiodic function is thought of as a periodic function with infite period
    -Delta W =0
    - L - > 00
    -No const term outside

Rewrite function as cos integral, apply eulers - >complex integration

Idea: How many 6Hz singals are in your current Singal? f(t)/6hz


FREQUENCY DOMAIN/SPATIAL DOMAIN
time(seconds) - > freq(hz)
pos(m) - > freq(permeter)
w= 2pi*(linear frequency)
Spatial Freq, the distance that has passed between each thing
    -Distance between 2 trees
